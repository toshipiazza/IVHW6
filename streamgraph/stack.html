  <h1>Stacked Rails</h1>

  <figcaption>Figure 1: Here we see a stacked bar graph for the number of lines changed
              across multiple files, by filetype for the rails project. The horizontal
              axis represents time elapsed, by month. Note the huge spike in changes
              in August, when there appears to have been a release in the rails codebase.

  <h1>Stacked Django</h1>
  <img src="./stacked/Django.png"></img>
  <figcaption>Figure 2: here we see a stacked bar graph, similar in nature to Figure 1,
              which instead represents the codebase for Django over time. Note that the
              graph differs greatly from the rails codebase in that it monotomically
              decreases throughout the lifetime of the project. This might be due to the
              fact that django is a faster moving project, or due to the fast paced development
              of python itself.
