    <figcaption>Figure 2: A streamgraph of the same vein as Figure 1, but which
                instead depicts the everlasting Django project (Toshi's personal
                favorite of the two). Clearly, we can see that the number of
                lines changed across all filetypes decrease monotonically as
                the end of 2015 grows near. This is in stark contrast to the rails
                project which spikes near its release. This is odd, because Django
                did have multiple releases in 2015, however it seems to be a faster
                moving project than rails, perhaps due to language development. This
                may contribute to the fact that the number of lines committed is almost
                a perfect monotomic curve, rather than spiky during release cycles.
