    <figcaption>Figure 1: Here we see a streamgraph representing the number of files, per filetype
                changed across the year 2015 for the almighty Rails project. As we move to the
                right the times increase chronologically by month. Meanwhile, each different
                colored area within the graph represents a separate filetype; the magnitude
                of the area is also proportional to the number of lines changed at that time.
                Clearly, we can see that there exists a huge spike in lines changed over almost
                all filetypes! This is partially due to a release occurring at around the same time.
